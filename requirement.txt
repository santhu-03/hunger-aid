Act as a senior Firebase + backend architect.

Implement an end-to-end food delivery assignment system for the HungerAid app using Firebase (Firestore + Cloud Functions).

SCENARIO:
1. A donor creates a food donation with pickup location (latitude, longitude).
2. A beneficiary accepts the food.
3. Once accepted:
   - The system must automatically find the NEAREST available volunteer.
   - The delivery task must be assigned to that volunteer.
4. The volunteer must have the option to:
   - ACCEPT the task → task status becomes "in_progress"
   - REJECT the task → system assigns the task to the next nearest volunteer.
5. If no volunteer accepts, mark task as "unassigned" and notify admin.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Firestore for data storage.
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions for backend logic.
- Use Expo push notifications to notify volunteers.
- Volunteers must be filtered by:
  - Availability status = "available"
  - Role = "volunteer"
  - Distance from pickup location (nearest first)
- Prevent race conditions (two volunteers accepting same task).
- Ensure secure role-based access.

DATA MODEL:
Design Firestore collections for:
- users (with role, availability, lastKnownLocation)
- donations
- deliveryTasks
- notifications

WORKFLOW LOGIC:
1. Beneficiary clicks "Accept Food"
2. Firestore trigger runs:
   - Create deliveryTask
   - Query volunteers ordered by distance
3. Assign task to nearest volunteer
4. Send push notification to volunteer
5. Volunteer response:
   - Accept → lock task to volunteer
   - Reject → update task + reassign to next nearest volunteer

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use GeoPoint for locations
- Use Haversine formula or geohash-based querying
- Use Firestore transactions for accept/reject
- Add TTL / timeout if volunteer does not respond
- Log assignment attempts

DELIVERABLES:
1. Firestore schema (collections & fields)
2. Cloud Function code (assignment & reassignment)
3. React Native logic for:
   - Beneficiary accept action
   - Volunteer accept/reject UI
4. Firestore security rules
5. Required Firestore indexes
6. Error handling & edge cases

- Reassign task automatically after 60 seconds if no response
- Show ETA to beneficiary
- Track volunteer live location
- Admin override assignment
