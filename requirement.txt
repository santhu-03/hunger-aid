Context

I already have a React Native (Expo) application using Firebase.
The Volunteer Dashboard → Transport Requests screen already exists and is functional.
Transport requests are created when a Beneficiary accepts a donation.

Now I want to enhance the UI/UX of the Transport Requests screen to give volunteers clear delivery information, including donor & beneficiary locations, food details, and action buttons.

🎯 Objective

Improve the Transport Requests UI so that each request clearly shows:

Donation details

Donor & beneficiary locations (map or location preview)

Food information

Accept / Reject delivery actions

All data must remain real-time from Firebase

🧱 UI STRUCTURE (PER TRANSPORT REQUEST CARD)
1️⃣ Donation Summary Card

Each transport request should be displayed as a clean card containing:

📦 Donation Information

Food type (Veg / Non-Veg)

Food name / category

Quantity (plates / kg / persons)

Packed time / pickup deadline

Any donor notes (optional)

Example fields from Firebase:

{
  "foodType": "Veg",
  "foodItems": ["Rice", "Dal"],
  "quantity": "10 plates",
  "pickupBefore": timestamp,
  "instructions": "Handle carefully"
}

2️⃣ Donor & Beneficiary Location Section
🗺️ Map / Location Preview

Show mini map view OR location cards with:

📍 Donor Pickup Location

📍 Beneficiary Drop Location

Options:

Use react-native-maps (preferred)

OR show address + distance if map already exists

Each location should show:

Address / landmark

Distance from volunteer (if available)

3️⃣ Volunteer Actions

Below each card:

✅ Accept Delivery Button

Confirms assignment

Updates Firebase:

"deliveryStatus": "accepted_by_volunteer"

❌ Reject Delivery Button

Rejects assignment

Triggers reassignment logic

Buttons must:

Disable once action is taken

Update UI in real time

4️⃣ Real-Time Status Indicator

Show current delivery status:

Pending

Accepted

In Transit

Update instantly using Firebase listeners

🔄 Real-Time Data Requirements

Use Firebase onSnapshot listeners

Any update must reflect instantly:

Donation acceptance

Volunteer response

Status changes

No manual refresh.

⚙️ Technical Constraints

Do NOT change existing navigation

Do NOT break current Firebase structure

Reuse existing donation & user collections

UI update only (logic already exists)



✅ Expected Outcome

Volunteers see rich, clear transport request cards

Each request includes:

Food details

Donor & beneficiary locations

Map or location preview

Accept / Reject actions

UI feels professional, informative, and delivery-ready
